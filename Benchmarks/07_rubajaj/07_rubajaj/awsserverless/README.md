CloudFormation Templates taken from GitHub repo:
https://github.com/rubajaj/AWSServerLess1

Note, that these templates appear to be generated automatically by the
user. 
There are some inconsistencies between expected types and actual ones
(my compiler complaines about them) and inconsistencies in the final
ontology model generated from these templates.
These inconsistencies are due to required properties not being specified.
